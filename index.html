      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Programming
      <ul>
        <li>This is a demanding class in terms of programming skills.</li>
        <li>HWs will involve a mix of languages (Python, C++) and libraries (PyTorch).</li>
        <li>Your language of choice for project.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Ability to deal with abstract mathematical concepts</li>
  </ul>

</div>

<p><a name="project"></a></p>
<div class="card">

  <h2 id="project-details-20-of-course-grade">Project Details (20% of course grade)</h2>

  <p>The class project is meant for students to (1) gain experience implementing
deep models and (2) try Deep Learning on problems that interest them. The
amount of effort should be at the level of one homework assignment per
group member (1-5 people per group).</p>

  <p>A PDF write-up describing the project in a self-contained manner will be the sole
deliverable.  Your final write-up is required to be between 4 - 6 pages using the 
template <a href="http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/sites/default/files/2019-09/cvpr2020AuthorKit.zip">here</a>, 
structured like a paper from a computer vision conference 
(CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, etc.). Please use this template so we can fairly judge all student 
projects without worrying about altered font sizes, margins, etc. After the class, we 
will post all the final reports online so that you can read about each others’ work. 
Addtionally, we will allow people to upload additional code, videos and other supplementary material
as zip file similar to code upload for assignments.
While the PDF may link to supplementary material, external documents and code, 
such resources may or may not be used to evaluate
the project. The final PDF should completely address all of the points in the
rubrik described below.</p>

  <h3 id="rubrik-60-points">Rubrik (60 points)</h3>

  <p>We are not looking to see if you succeeded or failed at accomplishing what you
set out to do. It’s ok if your results are not “good”. What matters is that
you put in a reasonable effort, understand the project and how it related to
Deep Learning in detail, and are able to clearly communicate that understanding.</p>

  <p>A former DARPA director named George H. Heilmeier came up with a <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism">list</a> of
questions for evaluating research projects.
We’ve adapted that list for our rubrik.</p>

  <p>Introduction / Background / Motivation:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>(5 points) What did you try to do? What problem did you try to solve? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</li>
    <li>(5 points) How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</li>
    <li>(5 points) Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Approach:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>(10 points) What did you do exactly? How did you solve the problem? Why did you think it would be successful? Is anything new in your approach?</li>
    <li>(5 points) What problems did you anticipate? What problems did you encounter? Did the very first thing you tried work?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Experiments and Results:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>(10 points) How did you measure success? What experiments were used? What were the results, both quantitative and qualitative? Did you succeed? Did you fail? Why?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition, 20 more points will be distributed based on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>(5 points) Appropriate use of figures / tables / visualizations. Are the ideas presented with
appropriate illustration? Are the results presented clearly; are the
important differences illustrated?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>(5 points) Overall clarity. Is the manuscript self-contained? Can a peer who has
also taken Deep Learning understand all of the points addressed above? Is
sufficient detail provided?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>(10 points) Finally, points will be distributed based on your understanding of how
your project relates to Deep Learning. Here are some questions to think about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What was the structure of your problem? How did the structure of your model
reflect the structure of your problem?</li>
        <li>What parts of your model had learned parameters (e.g., convolution layers)
and what parts did not (e.g., post-processing classifier probabilities into
decisions)?</li>
        <li>What representations of input and output did the neural network expect? How
was the data pre/post-processed?</li>
        <li>What was the loss function?</li>
        <li>Did the model overfit? How well did the approach generalize?</li>
        <li>What hyperparameters did the model have? How were they chosen? How did they
affect performance? What optimizer was used?</li>
        <li>What Deep Learning framework did you use?</li>
        <li>What existing code or models did you start with and what did those starting
points provide?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At least some of these questions and others should be relevant to your
  project and should be addressed in the PDF. You do not need to address
  all of them in full detail. Some may be irrelevant to your project and
  others may be standard and thus require only a brief mention. For example,
  it is sufficient to simply mention the cross-entropy loss was used and not
  provide a full description of what that is. Generally, provide enough
  detail that someone with an appropriate background (in both Deep Learning
  and your domain of choice) could replicate the main parts of your project
  somewhat accurately, probably missing a few less important details.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Submit the final report by uploading to “Final Project” assignment on Gradescope. 
There will be a group assignment corresponding to the project submission. 
Every group should submit the report once and all group
member names should be listed through the gradescope interface.
See instructions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rue7p_kATLA"> here.</a>
The supplementary material should also be uploaded as zip file to the Final Project (Supplementary Material) assignment.</p>

  <h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The class is full. Can I still get in?</p>

      <p>Sorry. The course admins in CoC control this process. Please talk to them.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Unregistered Students who intend to register:</p>

      <p>If you are not registered for this course, you will not have access to gradescope for submission of PS0. Please fill the following form in order to be added to gradescope and be able to submit PS0:
  <a href="https://forms.gle/sG8vB1vayXzgsKAA9">https://forms.gle/sG8vB1vayXzgsKAA9</a></p>

      <p>Students who individually emailed us and have not been added yet - you may have left out the details of which course instance you are planning to take (either CS 7643 or CS 4803). There are two separate gradescope courses for the two instances. Please fill the above form in order to provide us with this information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Registered students who are not able to access gradescope:</p>

      <p>This will happen if you were registered to the course very recently. Gradescope rosters are synced periodically and it may take some time for you to receive a gradescope sign-up notification. If you still face problems with accessing gradescope, please post a comment below.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>I am graduating this Fall and I need this class to complete my degree requirements. What should I do?</p>

      <p>Talk to the advisor or graduate coordinator for your academic program.  They are keeping track of your degree requirements and will work with you if you need a specific course.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Can I audit this class or take it pass/fail?</p>

      <p>No. Due to the large demand for this class, we will not be allowing audits or pass/fail. Letter grades only. This is to make sure students who want to take the class for credit can.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Can I simply sit in the class (no credits)?</p>

      <p>In general, we welcome members of the Georgia Tech community (students, staff, and/or faculty) to sit-in. Out of courtesy, we would appreciate if you let us know beforehand (via email or in person). If the classroom is full, we would ask that you please allow registered students to attend.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>I have a question. What is the best way to reach the course staff?</p>

      <p>Registered students – your first point of contact is Piazza (so that other students may benefit from your questions and our answers).
  If you have a personal matter, email us at the class mailing list <a href="mailto:f19-cs4803-cs7643-staff@googlegroups.com">f19-cs4803-cs7643-staff@googlegroups.com</a></p>
